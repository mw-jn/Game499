=======================================================================================================
This game derives from the course designing of the oversea university.
Although it's easy, it can express the process of the basic game design.
In current version, the game is implemented and can be played.
However, there also have some problem to solve, i.e. how to check the socket file description?
Maybe the select() can solve it.
Finally, I am only the beginner of the Linux system programing.
So I want to complete it in future.
